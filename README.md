**FirstAssignment, Numberic variables**

What is the purpose of this program(s)?

The purpose of this program is to take hard coded values for temperatures of a specific scale and convert them into other temperatures, as well as taking hard coded values for the cost of something in conjunction with an amount tendered and then provide the change with the following amounts of bills and coins that need to be given. 

What does this program take as input?

This progam takes hard coded variables as the input 

What is the expected out put of the program?

The temperatures converted from the hard coded input to the converted 

What type of execution is included in your program?

sequential execution

How could your program be improved?

I think the best way to improve the code would be to add a way to have the user input the values of the amount tendered as well as the cost. This would also be a good addition for the temperature values as well. Another good addition may be to check and ensure that the amount cost is not more than the amount tendered.
